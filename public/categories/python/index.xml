      <description>In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll continue to use the coin flip example from part 1. Recall that we are interested in the posterior distribution of the parameter θ, which is the probability that a coin toss results in “heads”. Our prior distribution is an uninformative beta distribution with parameters 1 and 1. We also used a binomial likelihood function to estimate how representative a candidate value for θ is to have generated the data we have on hand - 3 observed heads out of 9 tosses.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I will give you a relatively nontechnical introduction to Bayesian statistics. Bayesian methods are getting more and more popular and there are many tools out there to apply it. In this example, we&amp;rsquo;ll use a computationally simple example to pin down concepts and jargon. In a follow-up post, I will introduce the basics of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm to solve more complex problems.</description>
