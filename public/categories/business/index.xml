      <description>In this blog post we’ll focus especially on the task of writing. Emails, proposals, reports, and designs all convey our ideas. The way we dress up our ideas matter. Those who write poorly create barriers between themselves and their readers; those who write well connect with readers, open their minds, and achieve goals. Good writing gets ideas noticed. It gets them realized. So don’t be mislead: Writing well is a big deal.</description>
