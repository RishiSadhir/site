      <description>One of my favorite things about being a data scientist is running experiments. Often, data science teams will run a lot of repeated and related experiments about the same general thing - Usually, because we only have some short window to learn something or some other constraints. We run experiments to recover an effect size for something we care about. When the experiment is over, we have typically measured an effect size with some uncertainty (like a standard error) about this measurement.</description>

      <title>Intro to Bayes: Part 1</title>

      <description>In this blog post, I will give you a relatively nontechnical introduction to Bayesian statistics. Bayesian methods are getting more and more popular and there are many tools out there to apply it. In this example, we&#39;ll use a computationally simple example to pin down concepts and jargon. In a follow-up post, I will introduce the basics of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm to solve more complex problems.</description>

      <description>This is a retelling of Richard McElreath’s story about tea, oxen, and discrete parameters in Stan. In a Chinese village, children love tea but can only enjoy it after stabling their oxen. The problem is, children are liars sometimes and its up to us enforce the rules.
 You are the village enforcer of oxen customs… Each evening, you must determine which children have properly stabled their oxen. For many houses, you can see whether or not the ox is stabled.</description>

      <title>T-Test is not BEST</title>

      <description>In this post, we explore the task of comparing groups of measurements. We’ve all heard about the T-Test, but Bayesian statistics offers an interesting alternative. Let’s talk about how “Bayesian estimation supersedes the t-test” (Kruschke, 2013).
Preliminaries In this post, we’ll encode Kruschke’s methods in STAN and use it to compare action move ratings versus comedy movie ratings. The code shown below is also available in python here along with the supporting CSV.</description>
